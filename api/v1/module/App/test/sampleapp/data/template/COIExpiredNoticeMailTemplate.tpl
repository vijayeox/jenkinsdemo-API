                <p>Please remember, your policy is a "Claims Made" policy which means you are only covered if you have continuous coverage when the alleged negligent act took place, through when a claim against you. You can protect yourself by buying "Non-Teaching/Supervising Instructor" or "Retired" coverage. This Extended Reporting Period costs ${$cost} for 12 months until June 30, {$expiry_year}.</p><br/>
