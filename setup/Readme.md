### 4. <u>Run application using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)</u>

- For global credential update, copy .env.example to .env and change the credential according to your ip and other credentislas  
```bash
 $ cp  .env.example  .env
``` 
- To build the Docker image use the following command 
```bash
$ docker-compose --build
```

- To start api, camunda workflow, camel with activemq, view run below command 

```bash
$ docker-compose up --force-recreate
```
- To connect to the container using bash run the following command
```bash
$ docker exec -it setup_eox_1 bash
```

### 5. <u>You can access the application through the [url](http://localhost:8081)</u>
### 6. <u>The server API is available through the [url](http://localhost:8080)</u>
### 7. <u>You can access the mysql using phpmyadmin through the [url](http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin)</u>
### 8. <u>You can access the ActiveMq console through the [url](http://localhost:8161/)</u>
### 9. <u>You can connect to mysql from the bash prompt using mysql -hlocalhost -u<user> -p</u>

### Note 1: if you start application using docker-compose at root level of the project, then you have to update crdential only in .env file at root level, but if you run each application separately by entering into services, then update .env at respective places.
