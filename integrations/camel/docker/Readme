**********************************************
Step to run the Camel
**********************************************

Before we run the Docker, we need to make some changes to some configuration files in the resource folder.
The below lines needs to be changed when we the host IP changes (When there is a network switch)

Goto {root_folder}/integrations/camel/src/main/resources

Open the application.yml and 
    • change “localhost” to <Your IP> and 
    • change the user and password to your mysql username and password and 
    • create all the databases that are mentioned in the yml file 

Open oxzion.properties and 
    • change “localhost” to <Your IP> and 
    • change the username and password to your mysql username and password 

Open Routes.groovy 
    • change the callbackUrl IP to <your IP> 

We do not need to make any changes to the mail.properties for the development purpose, we can leave it as it is.
